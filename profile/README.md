## What is this?

This "Organization" (GitHub's term) was created for me to be able to control access to open source projects related to playing Capture The Flag games and Security Research

## Why not simply open source?

CTF and Security Research is a double-edged sword. We practice it to make our organizations and the internet a safer place, however these tools are inherently dual-use, and I want to make sure who I grant access to these projects are responsible people on the right side of the law.

## How do I get in?

Drop me a message on Discord (`idomino`) and I will invite you in. I will either need to know you personally or be able to confirm that you are responsible cyber security professional.

## Project List

- **Argonaut**: a lightweight, encrypted, and modular reverse shell written in Rust.
