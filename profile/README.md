## What is this?

This "Organization" (GitHub's term) was created for me to be able to control access to projects related to playing Capture The Flag games and Security Research

## Why not public open source?

CTF and Security Research is a double-edged sword. We practice it to make our organizations and the internet a safer place, however these tools are inherently dual-use, and I want to make sure who I grant access to these projects are responsible people on the right side of the law.

## How do I get in?

Drop me a message on Discord (`idomino`) and I will invite you in. I will either need to know you personally or be able to confirm that you are a responsible cyber security professional.

## Condition of membership

By being a member of this group you agree that any projects you have access to will only be used for legal purposes (e.g. playing Hack The Box) 

## Project List

- **Argonaut**: a lightweight, encrypted, and modular reverse shell written in Rust.
